# Page Rank

This Project developed for the university course of "Cloud Computing" reproduce the PageRank algorithm, that was the first algorithm used in Google to rank web pages in their search engine results.



# How to execute

Firstly be sure that 'wiki-micro.txt' is present in HDFS with:
```
hadoop fs -ls
```

## How to execute the Spark Page Rank application

Then, in the folder where the 'PageRank_Spark.py' is present execute:
```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit PageRank_Spark.py <input> <output> <iteration> <alpha>
```
With input 'wiki-micro.txt', output will be the folder in which the program will write the results 
divided into different file 'part-0000x' inside the output folder. To check result:
```
hadoop fs -cat output/part-0000x 
```

## How to execute the Hadoop Page Rank application

In the PageRank folder execute

```
mvn clean package
```

Then:
```
 hadoop jar target/PageRank-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar it.unipi.hadoop.PageRank <input> <output directory> <# of iterations> <# of reducers> <random jump probability>
```
You will retrieve the output in the ouput directory.
